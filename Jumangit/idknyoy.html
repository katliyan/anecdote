During quarantine I recognized the potential of ICT platforms to connect people with like-minded individuals and share ideas for a goal. I surfed various online communities focused on eco-friendly practices, particularly in gardening and sustainable living. By actively following and participating in these platforms, I not only gained valuable knowledge but also made new memories and experiences.

As a student during the pandemic, I embraced the principles of digital citizenship to contribute to  a topic about gardening. Through information and communication technologies (ICTs), I surfed and engaged with eco conscious communities who shared their strategies and experiences to spread knowledge to other individuals.

By exploring online communities, social media platforms, and dedicated websites, I discovered a wealth of resources related to various advocacies. I accessed articles, research papers, videos, and interactive content that deepened my understanding of critical issues and the importance of social causes. Online forums and discussion boards provided spaces where I could engage with individuals from different backgrounds, exchanging ideas, sharing experiences, and learning from one another. 


My engagement with these online eco-friendly communities not only enriched my gardening knowledge but also expanded my understanding of sustainable living. By utilizing ICT platforms, I somewhat became part of a global movement, striving towards a greener future.
